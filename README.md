## Description
This project will explore using machine learning with EEG data. 

A preliminary idea we have is exploring the issue with lack of EEG data in research. What if we could
generate EEG data by inputing a new image into a machine learning model that was trained on previous EEG data. 
We will use Tim Elmore's research on how humans process and remember visual information from images.
