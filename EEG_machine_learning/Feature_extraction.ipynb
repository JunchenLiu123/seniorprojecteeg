    "# Feature Extraction\n",
    "* A common method of EEG classification encountered during research of literary sources was feature extraction. \n",
    "* Using the data points of the signals is not a good way to classify.\n",
    "* However, extracting statistical, and signal processing related features may help significantly improve our classification results.\n",
    "* There are over a hundred features that can be extracted from EEG based on the sources read.\n",
    "* This notebook will try to explore a few of in the following realms:\n",
    "    1. Statisical \n",
    "        * mean, median, std\n",
    "    2. Time Domain\n",
    "        * hjorth paramter, 1st difference mean and maximum\n",
    "    3. Frequency Domain\n",
    "        * Converting time domain signals into frequency domain signals with Fourier transform.\n",
    "        * Caluclating band power and max power with FT.\n",
    "    4. Wavelet-based features\n",
    "        * Discrete Wavelet Transform (High pass and Low Pass)\n",
    "    5. Auto-regressive Coefficients\n",
    "        * AR model of order 6 using Burg's Algorithm. Using the coefficients as features.\n",
    "* All of the feature domains will be explained further throughout the notebook.\n",
