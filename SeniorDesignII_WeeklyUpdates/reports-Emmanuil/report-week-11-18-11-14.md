## Stretch Goals (1-3)

* Classifying Lexical vs Non-lexical labels

## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (next week)

You should be able to tie this to the strech goals. If you can't perhaps you don't understand the big picture.
Use concise language, but include relevant information. Be positive when answering the questions. You must have
3-5 of these and you will be measured on how you do.


### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 1.

#### S. Specific: 
(What do you want to accomplish? Who needs to be included? When do you want to do this? Why is this a goal?)
* Straightforward classification of lexical vs non-lexical labels using the same pipeline for audio vs visual.

#### M. Measurable: 
(How can you measure progress and know if you’ve successfully met your goal?)
* I will have code in a jupyter notebook that has each step of the pipeline.

#### A. Achievable: 
(Do you have the skills required to achieve the goal? If not, can you obtain them? What is the motivation for this goal? Is the amount of effort required on par with what the goal will achieve?)
* I just need to change the labels of the previous Audio vs Visual problem to use Lexical vs Non-lexical lablels. The 
preprocessing is set up to make this a simple process.

#### R. Relevant :
(Why am I setting this goal now? Is it aligned with overall objectives like stretch goals?)
* This problem is the next step in the sequences to solve. Using the same pipeline with the only difference
being the labels is useful to see.

#### T. Time-bound: 
(What’s the deadline and is it realistic?)
* Next week

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 2.

#### S. Specific: 
(What do you want to accomplish? Who needs to be included? When do you want to do this? Why is this a goal?)
* Break up the Lexical vs Non-lexical problem into smaller components. There are visual stimuli that are lexical and non-lexical, 
as well as audio stimuli that follow the same format. This goal will break up the lexicality problem in terms of audio vs visual.

#### M. Measurable: 
(How can you measure progress and know if you’ve successfully met your goal?)
Fill in (this should be crisp like implment a specific function, produce a notebook with certain graphs, etc. If it is not something
obvious to me how I would grade success, partial sucess and failure, then you lose points.)
* I will generate confusion matrices with results of my classification along with the code.

#### A. Achievable: 
(Do you have the skills required to achieve the goal? If not, can you obtain them? What is the motivation for this goal? Is the amount of effort required on par with what the goal will achieve?)
* It will take a little bit of manipulation of the labels, then just a matter of fitting to the same pipeline.

#### R. Relevant :
(Why am I setting this goal now? Is it aligned with overall objectives like stretch goals?)
* yes it is because we are still trying to patterns and signals in the brain when solving these classification problems.


#### T. Time-bound: 
(What’s the deadline and is it realistic?)
* Next week

## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (last week)
List the smart goals you completed last week. First list the goal, and then list the locations of the commits or urls of the artificats promised in the smart goal that stand as evidence that what was goal was completed. If there is no such artificat (even if none was promised. This is a zero.)
* Smart Goal 1 to visualize frequency bands: 
  * A figure of this is located in this [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1a7fuMzn1faI3waI6U6UEXspaoYfVGveayHIA5a_qvLc/edit?usp=sharing) slide 12
  * This code is actually just a simple MNE python method of an Epoch object.
* Smart Gaol 2 classification
  * The code is found in this [repo](https://github.com/edrias/seniorprojecteeg/blob/master/preprocessing/frequency_bands.ipynb)
      * Starting from Markdown titles *Isolating Channels of Visual and Audio Channels*
