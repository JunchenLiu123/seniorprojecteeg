## Stretch Goals (1-3)

1. classify modalities (audio vs visual) and get a score of 60 - 70% accuracy.  

## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (next week)

You should be able to tie this to the strech goals. If you can't perhaps you don't understand the big picture.
Use concise language, but include relevant information. Be positive when answering the questions. You must have
3-5 of these and you will be measured on how you do.



### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 1.

#### S. Specific: 
(What do you want to accomplish? Who needs to be included? When do you want to do this? Why is this a goal?)
* Be able to describe epochs by the describer events such as concept of stimulus, congruency of the trial that the stimulus belongs
to. 

#### M. Measurable: 
(How can you measure progress and know if you’ve successfully met your goal?)
* I will be able to generate event ids for an epoch object that includes describer events. Code to generate these, will be in a 
jupyter notebook.

#### A. Achievable: 
(Do you have the skills required to achieve the goal? If not, can you obtain them? What is the motivation for this goal? Is the amount of effort required on par with what the goal will achieve?)
* I have the original trigger files for each subject that I can use a reference. Each event in a file is time stamped with in seconds.
And the epoch file events are time stamped in number of samples, I can convert the times from seconds to samples and match the times 
between trials.

#### R. Relevant :
(Why am I setting this goal now? Is it aligned with overall objectives like stretch goals?)
* Completing this goal will allow the group to solve future problems such as congrueuncy, stimulus concept, etc.

#### T. Time-bound: 
(What’s the deadline and is it realistic?)
* For next meeting

## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (last week)
List the smart goals you completed last week. First list the goal, and then list the locations of the commits or urls of the artificats promised in the smart goal that stand as evidence that what was goal was completed. If there is no such artificat (even if none was promised. This is a zero.)
