 ## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (next week)

 Converting raw data into epoched data with labels
 Doing EDA on the epoched data
 Use dimension reductions on the epoched data for better classfication. 


 ### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 1.

 #### S. Specific: 
 (What do you want to accomplish? Who needs to be included? When do you want to do this? Why is this a goal?)
 * First converting all the raw data into filtered epoched data so that data visiualization and EDA can be more easily achieved.
 then try dimension reductions technques on the filtered epoched data. The goal is to extract useful features from the data for better classficaiton scores.

 #### M. Measurable: 
 (How can you measure progress and know if you’ve successfully met your goal?)
 * We can measure the goal is successfully meet by comparing the classfication scores befroe and after doing dimension reduction.

 #### A. Achievable: 
 (Do you have the skills required to achieve the goal? If not, can you obtain them? What is the motivation for this goal? Is the amount of effort required on par with what the goal will achieve?)
 * This is achievable because there are online examples on how to using dimension reduction technique on large data. We can follow those example and
 use it on our code.

 #### R. Relevant :
 (Why am I setting this goal now? Is it aligned with overall objectives like stretch goals?)
 * This goal is relevant with the overall goal because the main point of this project is to use classfication to find useful information from
 EEG data, by doing dimension reduction to extract features of our data, it might be easier for us to classfy our data and get more information.

 #### T. Time-bound: 
 (What’s the deadline and is it realistic?)
 * by 23rd. 
 
 
 ### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 2.

 #### S. Specific: 
 (What do you want to accomplish? Who needs to be included? When do you want to do this? Why is this a goal?)
 * I want to be able to reduce the dimension of the data from 3D to 2D
 #### M. Measurable: 
 (How can you measure progress and know if you’ve successfully met your goal?)
 * We can measure progress by checking the shape of the data after doing dimension reduction.
 #### A. Achievable: 
 (Do you have the skills required to achieve the goal? If not, can you obtain them? What is the motivation for this goal? Is the amount of effort required on par with what the goal will achieve?)
 * This can be achieve because we can use online library for dimension reduction to reduce our data

 #### R. Relevant :
 (Why am I setting this goal now? Is it aligned with overall objectives like stretch goals?)
 * it aligned with overy objectives because by doing dimension reduction, it makes our data easier to classfy.
 #### T. Time-bound: 
 (What’s the deadline and is it realistic?)
 * by 23rd. 
 
  ### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 2.

 #### S. Specific: 
 (What do you want to accomplish? Who needs to be included? When do you want to do this? Why is this a goal?)
 * i want to be able to use different binary classfier on our data to achive higher classfication score
 #### M. Measurable: 
 (How can you measure progress and know if you’ve successfully met your goal?)
 * We can measure progress by printing our the classfication scores for different classfiers and compare them.
 #### A. Achievable: 
 (Do you have the skills required to achieve the goal? If not, can you obtain them? What is the motivation for this goal? Is the amount of effort required on par with what the goal will achieve?)
 * This can be achieve because we can use online library for classfiying data and fit them into different classfiers

 #### R. Relevant :
 (Why am I setting this goal now? Is it aligned with overall objectives like stretch goals?)
 * it aligned with overall objectives because we want to have good classfcation scores to discriminate between congruent and incongruent.
 #### T. Time-bound: 
 (What’s the deadline and is it realistic?)
 * by 23rd.
