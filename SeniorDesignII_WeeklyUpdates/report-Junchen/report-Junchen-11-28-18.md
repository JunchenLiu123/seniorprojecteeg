# Smart and Stretch Goals

**Name:** Junchen Liu
**Date:** 11/25/18

## Stretch Goals (1-3)

1. Use Random Forest classfier to do classfication and make use of the feature importance and compare top most important channels
for different subject files
2. Select the top 20 most important channels for each subjects can compare

## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (next week)

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 1.

#### S. Specific: 
Use Random Forest classfier to classfy different subject data and compare classfication results

#### M. Measurable: 
This goal is measurable because Skicit-learn provides Random Forest library which we can use directly to train our data.

#### A. Achievable: 
Yes this is achievable since we have done something similar with other classifier such as KNN before.

#### R. Relevant :
This goal is relevant because we want to see how's the performance of Random Forest on our data.

#### T. Time-bound: 
I aim to get this done by 12/5/2018. 

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 2.

#### S. Specific: 
Use Random Forest classfier to classfy different subject data and access feature importance variable to perform feature selection
on our data to select the top important channels.

#### M. Measurable: 
This goal is measurable because Skicit-learn provides Random Forest library which we can use directly on our data, it also provides us with the method call
feature importance that we can directly access.

#### A. Achievable: 
Yes this is achievable since we are able to train our data with Random Forest and get the feature importance data.

#### R. Relevant :
This goal is relevant because we want can select the top most important channels and do classfication to see if we get better scores.

#### T. Time-bound: 
I aim to get this done by 12/5/2018. 

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 3.

#### S. Specific: 
I will compare the top 20 most important channels for different subject files to see if the channels are consistent
#### M. Measurable: 
This goal is measurable because Skicit-learn provides Random Forest library which we can use directly on our data, it also provides us with the method call
feature importance that we can directly access.

#### A. Achievable: 
Yes this is achievable since we are able to train our data with Random Forest and get the feature importance data.

#### R. Relevant :
This goal will help because it allows us to see if Randon Forest can be a good choice for feature extraction to improve accuracy and
if the channels are consistent when dealling with either lexicality or modality problem

#### T. Time-bound: 
Next week, 12/5/18
