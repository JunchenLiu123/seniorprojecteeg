## Stretch Goals (1-3)

1. Pre-process the data for artifact removal


## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (next week)
### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 1.

#### S. Specific: 
(What do you want to accomplish? Who needs to be included? When do you want to do this? Why is this a goal?)
* This week I will be loading the EEG data provided by Dave into Matlab EEGlab and then use EEGlab to convert the .CNT file into MNE readable file such as .set file or .edf file. After that I will be running the different machine learning python scripts to play around the data. more direction and confirm its relevancy to his work. 

#### M. Measurable: 
(How can you measure progress and know if you’ve successfully met your goal?)
* We all are able to have access to Dave’s data with a better understanding about what the experiment is about and how it was conducted, and we have finished our revised proposal with a common sets of goal on what we are aiming for.

#### A. Achievable: 
(Do you have the skills required to achieve the goal? If not, can you obtain them? What is the motivation for this goal? Is the amount of effort required on par with what the goal will achieve?)
* The data sets were downloaded to each of ours computer which allow us to do different kind of data analysis on it. Right now we have a entirely revised problem statement for our proposal, so I will be also doing researches for different academic papers in order to find solutions to the problem statement.
#### R. Relevant :
(Why am I setting this goal now? Is it aligned with overall objectives like stretch goals?)
* The project was about how to use machine learning in EEG data to produce useful information out of it. This is critical because it will be helpful for psychologist to study the human brain.

#### T. Time-bound: 
(What’s the deadline and is it realistic?)
* the deadline is 09/19/2018. 

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 2.

#### S. Specific: 
(What do you want to accomplish? Who needs to be included? When do you want to do this? Why is this a goal?)
*  Finish converting all the .cnt file into .set file, we have to do it manually since there are no specific scripts for matlab to do it.

#### M. Measurable: 
(How can you measure progress and know if you’ve successfully met your goal?)
* This goal is measurable because 66 .set files were converted

#### A. Achievable: 
(Do you have the skills required to achieve the goal? If not, can you obtain them? What is the motivation for this goal? Is the amount of effort required on par with what the goal will achieve?)
* Converting .CNT file into .SET files which MNE can read. This can be achieve because we can use Matlab to finish the convertion.
#### R. Relevant :
(Why am I setting this goal now? Is it aligned with overall objectives like stretch goals?)
* This goal is important because it allows each of us to access the data using MNE which we are familiar with. 

#### T. Time-bound: 
(What’s the deadline and is it realistic?)
* The deadline is 09/19/2018.  

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 3.

#### S. Specific: 
(What do you want to accomplish? Who needs to be included? When do you want to do this? Why is this a goal?)
* I will look up a list of different ways for removing artifacts from the .set files data we have.
#### M. Measurable: 
(How can you measure progress and know if you’ve successfully met your goal?)
* I will check if i successfully meet my goal by plotting the data and see if the artifact still exist.

#### A. Achievable: 
(Do you have the skills required to achieve the goal? If not, can you obtain them? What is the motivation for this goal? Is the amount of effort required on par with what the goal will achieve?)
* This goal is achieveable beacuse there are many online instructions on how to remove artifacts, we could follow that.

#### R. Relevant :
(Why am I setting this goal now? Is it aligned with overall objectives like stretch goals?)
* Removing artifacts is very important steps to take before using machine learning on data.

#### T. Time-bound: 
(What’s the deadline and is it realistic?)
* The deadline is 09/19/2018. This is a soft deadline, and may continue on into next week if necessary.
