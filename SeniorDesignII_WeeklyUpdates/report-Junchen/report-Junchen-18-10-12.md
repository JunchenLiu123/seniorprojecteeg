# Smart and Stretch Goals

## Stretch Goals (1-3)

1. Start working on Langauge vs. Non-Language


## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (next week)

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 1.

#### S. Specific: 
Use KNN to classify language vs. non-langiage events and see the classfication scores.

#### M. Measurable: 
I can measure this goal by using the built in algorithmn of skillearn to measure the classfication scores of  Language vs. non-language

#### A. Achievable: 
Yes. This is achieveable because I have done similar classfication methods before.

#### R. Relevant :
This goal is relevant to solving more important classification problems since been able to classfify language vs. nonlanguage will help us on classfying better classficaition problems.

#### T. Time-bound: 
It is due next week: 10/17/18

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 2.

#### S. Specific: 
I want to be able to label each trials of our data into either Language or nonlanguages

#### M. Measurable: 
This is measurable because I can check the label of te data to make sure my data is clearly labeled and idenitified.

#### A. Achievable: 
Yes, our data is in epoch form which allow python index accessing that helps me to label the data.

#### R. Relevant :
This is relevant because by having clearly labeling data, we can get better classfication results.

#### T. Time-bound: 
Next week, 10/17/18

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 3.

#### S. Specific: 
Doing classfications using KNN on the labeled language vs. Nonlanguages data for diffrent subjects files and compare the classfication scores. 

#### M. Measurable: 
This is measurable because once goal#1 and goal#2 is finished, goal#3 can be done based on those. I just have to run it on more subjects files to compare the results.

#### A. Achievable: 
Yes, This is achievable because Goal#1 and Goal#2 is achievable, and I can compare the classficaiton results on a bar grah which give me better understanding of our data.

#### R. Relevant :
This will be helpful because by running KNN on the labeled data for diffrent subject files, We can tell which files give better scores.


#### T. Time-bound: 
I aim for next week, 10/20/18.
