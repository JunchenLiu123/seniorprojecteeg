## Stretch Goals (1-3)

1. Pre-process the data for artifact removal


## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (next week)
### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 1.

#### S. Specific: 
(What do you want to accomplish? Who needs to be included? When do you want to do this? Why is this a goal?)
*  I want to be able to make sense out of Dave’s data and codes
 

#### M. Measurable: 
(How can you measure progress and know if you’ve successfully met your goal?)
* I will be running the python scripts provide by Dave to generate useful information of the data.


#### A. Achievable: 
(Do you have the skills required to achieve the goal? If not, can you obtain them? What is the motivation for this goal? Is the amount of effort required on par with what the goal will achieve?)
* The data sets were downloaded to each of ours computer. We are all provided with a python scripts by Dave. We will try to play around with the code to convert the data into MNE python readable raw data. I will use MNE and sklearn for the algorithm.
#### R. Relevant :
(Why am I setting this goal now? Is it aligned with overall objectives like stretch goals?)
* The project was about how to use machine learning in EEG data to produce useful information out of it. Our role so far is to develop a clear set of easy problem to solve with simpler machine learning tools, followed by a secondary set of more difficult problem we aim to solve.


#### T. Time-bound: 
(What’s the deadline and is it realistic?)
* the deadline is 09/12/2018. 

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 2.

#### S. Specific: 
(What do you want to accomplish? Who needs to be included? When do you want to do this? Why is this a goal?)
*  Be able to find out a methods to convert our data into MNE readable format.

#### M. Measurable: 
(How can you measure progress and know if you’ve successfully met your goal?)
* This goal is measurable because MNE will be able to convert our data into more useful form for machine learning purpose.

#### A. Achievable: 
(Do you have the skills required to achieve the goal? If not, can you obtain them? What is the motivation for this goal? Is the amount of effort required on par with what the goal will achieve?)
* This is achievable because there are many online papers on how to convert .cnt files to other document format that MNE can read.
#### R. Relevant :
(Why am I setting this goal now? Is it aligned with overall objectives like stretch goals?)
* This goal is important because it allows each of us to access the data using MNE which we are familiar with. 

#### T. Time-bound: 
(What’s the deadline and is it realistic?)
* The deadline is 09/12/2018.  

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 3.

#### S. Specific: 
(What do you want to accomplish? Who needs to be included? When do you want to do this? Why is this a goal?)
* I will look up a list of different ways for removing artifacts once the .cnt files was converted to MNE readable file.
#### M. Measurable: 
(How can you measure progress and know if you’ve successfully met your goal?)
* I will check if i successfully meet my goal by plotting the data and see if the artifact still exist.

#### A. Achievable: 
(Do you have the skills required to achieve the goal? If not, can you obtain them? What is the motivation for this goal? Is the amount of effort required on par with what the goal will achieve?)
* This goal is achieveable beacuse there are many online instructions on how to remove artifacts, we could follow that.

#### R. Relevant :
(Why am I setting this goal now? Is it aligned with overall objectives like stretch goals?)
* Removing artifacts is very important steps to take before using machine learning on data.

#### T. Time-bound: 
(What’s the deadline and is it realistic?)
* The deadline is 09/12/2018. This is a soft deadline, and may continue on into next week if necessary.
