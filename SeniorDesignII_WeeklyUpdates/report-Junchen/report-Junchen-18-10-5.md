 ## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (next week)

 Converting raw data into epoched data with labels
 combining 9 epochs into one to make it a trial
 labeling the epochs trial as either congruent or incongruent

 ### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 1.

 #### S. Specific: 
 (What do you want to accomplish? Who needs to be included? When do you want to do this? Why is this a goal?)
 * I want to be able to dividing the whole subject epoch into trials and label those trials as either congruent or incongruent by changing the 9 epochs eventid as either 133,134
 #### M. Measurable: 
 (How can you measure progress and know if you’ve successfully met your goal?)
 * The progress can be measure by printting out the plot and check whether the event ids are changed or not.
 #### A. Achievable: 
 (Do you have the skills required to achieve the goal? If not, can you obtain them? What is the motivation for this goal? Is the amount of effort required on par with what the goal will achieve?)
 * This is achievable because we can access the the epoch data event id using python numpy methods and change the event id when conditions were met.

 #### R. Relevant :
 (Why am I setting this goal now? Is it aligned with overall objectives like stretch goals?)
 * This goal is relevant with the overall goal because the main point of this project is to use classfication to find useful information from
 EEG data, by making the trials as either congruent or incongruent, we will be able to do classfication easily.
 #### T. Time-bound: 
 (What’s the deadline and is it realistic?)
 * by 10th. 
 
 
 ### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 2.

 #### S. Specific: 
 (What do you want to accomplish? Who needs to be included? When do you want to do this? Why is this a goal?)
 * I want to be able to label the data as congruent and incongruent trials and using knn to classify the data
 #### M. Measurable: 
 (How can you measure progress and know if you’ve successfully met your goal?)
 * We can measure progress by fitting the labeled data into knn classfiers and print out the scores.
 #### A. Achievable: 
 (Do you have the skills required to achieve the goal? If not, can you obtain them? What is the motivation for this goal? Is the amount of effort required on par with what the goal will achieve?)
 * This can be achieve because we can use online library for KNN classfier.

 #### R. Relevant :
 (Why am I setting this goal now? Is it aligned with overall objectives like stretch goals?)
 * it aligned with overy objectives because we can test whether knn is a good classfier for classfying our data congruent vs. incongruent.
 #### T. Time-bound: 
 (What’s the deadline and is it realistic?)
 * by 10th. 
 
  ### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 3.

 #### S. Specific: 
 (What do you want to accomplish? Who needs to be included? When do you want to do this? Why is this a goal?)
 * I want to be able to get good classfication scores using knn for our labeled data.
 #### M. Measurable: 
 (How can you measure progress and know if you’ve successfully met your goal?)
 * We can measure progress by playing around wiht the hyper parameter of my knn pipeline and check the scores
 #### A. Achievable: 
 (Do you have the skills required to achieve the goal? If not, can you obtain them? What is the motivation for this goal? Is the amount of effort required on par with what the goal will achieve?)
 * This can be achieve because we can use python to decompose the events and put 9 of them together as one trials.

 #### R. Relevant :
 (Why am I setting this goal now? Is it aligned with overall objectives like stretch goals?)
 * it aligned with overall objectives because we want to classfy between congruent and incongruent, and those trials are either congruent or incongruent.
 (What’s the deadline and is it realistic?)
 * by 3rd.
