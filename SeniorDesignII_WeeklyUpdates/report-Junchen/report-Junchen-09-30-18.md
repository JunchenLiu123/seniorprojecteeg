## Stretch Goals (1-3)

1. Be able to contact Dave and come up a list of questions to Dave
2. Be able to divided our data into trials.

 ## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (next week)

 Converting raw data into epoched data with labels
 Doing EDA on the epoched data
 combining 9 epochs into one to make it a trial


 ### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 1.

 #### S. Specific: 
 (What do you want to accomplish? Who needs to be included? When do you want to do this? Why is this a goal?)
 * Doing EDA on the epoched data for better visualization of the data.
 #### M. Measurable: 
 (How can you measure progress and know if you’ve successfully met your goal?)
 * We can measure the goal is successfully meet by printing different kind of EDA representing different structures or characteristics of our data.

 #### A. Achievable: 
 (Do you have the skills required to achieve the goal? If not, can you obtain them? What is the motivation for this goal? Is the amount of effort required on par with what the goal will achieve?)
 * This is achievable because there are online mne library that provides different methods for doing EDA on our data

 #### R. Relevant :
 (Why am I setting this goal now? Is it aligned with overall objectives like stretch goals?)
 * This goal is relevant with the overall goal because the main point of this project is to use classfication to find useful information from
 EEG data, by doing EDA to on our data, we will be able to find features that are most relevant for our classfication
 #### T. Time-bound: 
 (What’s the deadline and is it realistic?)
 * by 3th. 
 
 
 ### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 2.

 #### S. Specific: 
 (What do you want to accomplish? Who needs to be included? When do you want to do this? Why is this a goal?)
 * I want to be able to reduce the dimension of the data from 3D to 2D
 #### M. Measurable: 
 (How can you measure progress and know if you’ve successfully met your goal?)
 * We can measure progress by checking the shape of the data after doing dimension reduction.
 #### A. Achievable: 
 (Do you have the skills required to achieve the goal? If not, can you obtain them? What is the motivation for this goal? Is the amount of effort required on par with what the goal will achieve?)
 * This can be achieve because we can use online library for dimension reduction to reduce our data

 #### R. Relevant :
 (Why am I setting this goal now? Is it aligned with overall objectives like stretch goals?)
 * it aligned with overy objectives because by doing dimension reduction, it makes our data easier to classfy.
 #### T. Time-bound: 
 (What’s the deadline and is it realistic?)
 * by 3rd. 
 
  ### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 3.

 #### S. Specific: 
 (What do you want to accomplish? Who needs to be included? When do you want to do this? Why is this a goal?)
 * I want to reduce the the 5420 epochs into trials with 9 epochs each
 #### M. Measurable: 
 (How can you measure progress and know if you’ve successfully met your goal?)
 * We can measure progress by putting 9 epochs into a list as a trial and then put all the trials into one big list
 #### A. Achievable: 
 (Do you have the skills required to achieve the goal? If not, can you obtain them? What is the motivation for this goal? Is the amount of effort required on par with what the goal will achieve?)
 * This can be achieve because we can use python to decompose the events and put 9 of them together as one trials.

 #### R. Relevant :
 (Why am I setting this goal now? Is it aligned with overall objectives like stretch goals?)
 * it aligned with overall objectives because we want to classfy between congruent and incongruent, and those trials are either congruent or incongruent.
 (What’s the deadline and is it realistic?)
 * by 3rd.
