**Name:** Junchen Liu

## Stretch Goals (1-3)

1. Find the variance across each channels and find the obnormal channels.
2. Try to do classfication on the obnormal channels.

## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (next week)

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 1.

#### S. Specific: 
Looping through the data and find the variance across each 5o points for each channels.

#### M. Measurable: 
This goal is measurable by manually checking the shape of our data. which from (987,129,500) -> (987,129,10) since 50 points now will become 1 points.

#### A. Achievable: 
Yes this is achievable because our epoch data can support various array operations which allow us to perform all kinds of operation in our data.

#### R. Relevant :
This goal is relevant because we have to see which channels will give us the highest variance, from that we can conclude that's the channels that contributes the most to classfication.

#### T. Time-bound: 
I aim to get this done by 11/14/2018. 

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 2.

#### S. Specific: 
Looping through the data and find the variance across each 100 points for each channels.

#### M. Measurable: 
This goal is measurable by manually checking the shape of our data. which from (987,129,500) -> (987,129,5) since 100 points now will become 1 points.

#### A. Achievable: 
Yes this is achievable because our epoch data can support various array operations which allow us to perform all kinds of operation in our data.

#### R. Relevant :
This goal is relevant because we have to see which channels will give us the highest variance, from that we can conclude that's the channels that contributes the most to classfication.

#### T. Time-bound: 
I aim to get this done by 11/14/2018.
