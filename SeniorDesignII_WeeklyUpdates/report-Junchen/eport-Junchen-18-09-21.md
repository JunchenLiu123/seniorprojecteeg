## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (next week)

Converting raw data into epoched data with labels
Doing EDA on the epoched data
Use dimension reductions on the epoched data for better classfication. 


### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 1.

#### S. Specific: 
(What do you want to accomplish? Who needs to be included? When do you want to do this? Why is this a goal?)
* First converting all the raw data into filtered epoched data so that data visiualization and EDA can be more easily achieved.
then try dimension reductions technques on the filtered epoched data. The goal is to extract useful features from the data for better classficaiton scores.

#### M. Measurable: 
(How can you measure progress and know if you’ve successfully met your goal?)
* We can measure the goal is successfully meet by comparing the classfication scores befroe and after doing dimension reduction.

#### A. Achievable: 
(Do you have the skills required to achieve the goal? If not, can you obtain them? What is the motivation for this goal? Is the amount of effort required on par with what the goal will achieve?)
* This is achievable because there are online examples on how to using dimension reduction technique on large data. We can follow those example and
use it on our code.

#### R. Relevant :
(Why am I setting this goal now? Is it aligned with overall objectives like stretch goals?)
* This goal is relevant with the overall goal because the main point of this project is to use classfication to find useful information from
EEG data, by doing dimension reduction to extract features of our data, it might be easier for us to classfy our data and get more information.

#### T. Time-bound: 
(What’s the deadline and is it realistic?)
* I'm setting a deadline is by the 22th.  

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 2.

#### S. Specific: 
(What do you want to accomplish? Who needs to be included? When do you want to do this? Why is this a goal?)
* Label data with events using .trg files. Without labeled data we cannot perform classification. 

#### M. Measurable: 
(How can you measure progress and know if you’ve successfully met your goal?)
Fill in (this should be crisp like implment a specific function, produce a notebook with certain graphs, etc. If it is not something
obvious to me how I would grade success, partial sucess and failure, then you lose points.)
I will write batch scripts for creating epoched and event labaled data for all files, then distribute to group members via OneDrive. 

#### A. Achievable: 
(Do you have the skills required to achieve the goal? If not, can you obtain them? What is the motivation for this goal? Is the amount of effort required on par with what the goal will achieve?)
Yes, I have already started this process on one file for testing purposes, so writing a batch script will be simple, but time consuming to run.

#### R. Relevant :
(Why am I setting this goal now? Is it aligned with overall objectives like stretch goals?)
To get immediate results, we can just use one fully preprocessed file, but eventually we will need to classify all subjects together.

#### T. Time-bound: 
(What’s the deadline and is it realistic?)
Would like to get this done by September 23rd

## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (last week)
List the smart goals you completed last week. First list the goal, and then list the locations of the commits or urls of the artificats promised in the smart goal that stand as evidence that what was goal was completed. If there is no such artificat (even if none was promised. This is a zero.)
* goal for labeling events: https://github.com/edrias/seniorprojecteeg/blob/master/preprocessing/Events.ipynb
* goal for artifact removing : https://github.com/edrias/seniorprojecteeg/blob/master/preprocessing/Artifact_Removal/Filtering_Resampling.ipynb
