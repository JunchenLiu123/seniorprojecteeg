# Smart and Stretch Goals

**Name:** Junchen Liu

## Stretch Goals (1-3)

1. Use Random Forest classfier to do classfication and make use of the feature importance
2. Select only the top 20 most important channels and classify gain

## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (next week)

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 1.

#### S. Specific: 
Use Random Forest classfier to classfy on 1 subject files.

#### M. Measurable: 
This goal is measurable because Skicit-learn provides Random Forest library which we can use directly on our data.

#### A. Achievable: 
Yes this is achievable since we have done something similar with other classifier such as KNN before.

#### R. Relevant :
This goal is relevant because we want to see how's performance of Random Forest on our data.

#### T. Time-bound: 
I aim to get this done by 11/27/2018. 

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 2.

#### S. Specific: 
Use Random Forest classfier to classfy 1 subject data and access feature importance variable to perform feature selection on our data.

#### M. Measurable: 
This goal is measurable because Skicit-learn provides Random Forest library which we can use directly on our data, it also provides us with the method call
feature importance that we can directly access.

#### A. Achievable: 
Yes this is achievable since we are able to train our data with Random Forest and get the feature importance data.

#### R. Relevant :
This goal is relevant because we want select only the top most important features based on random forest. based on the deciding factors we predict 
that they will correlate with the parts of the brain that are responsible for making such decisions.

#### T. Time-bound: 
I aim to get this done by 11/27/2018. 

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 3.

#### S. Specific: 
I will use Logistical Regression to do classfication on the top channels data obtain get from Goal#2 and compare the result.
#### M. Measurable: 
I will measure this goal by comparing classfication scores of reduced data we get for both Logistical Regression and Randon Forest

#### A. Achievable: 
Yes, This is achievable because I have Skilearn library that provides us with different classfication algorithmn.

#### R. Relevant :
This goal will help because it allows us to see if Randon Forest can be a good choice for feature extraction to improve accuracy.

#### T. Time-bound: 
Next week, 11/27/18
