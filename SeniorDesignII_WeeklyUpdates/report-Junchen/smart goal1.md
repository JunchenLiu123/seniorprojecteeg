Smart Goal: I want to be able to make sense out of Dave’s data and codes

Specific: I will be running the python scripts provide by Dave to generate useful information of the data.

Measurable: We all are able to have access to Dave’s data with a better understanding about what the experiment is about and how it was conducted.

Actionable: The data sets were downloaded to each of ours computer. We are all provided with a python scripts by Dave. We will try to play around with the code to convert the data into MNE python readable raw data. I will use MNE and sklearn for the algorithm.

 Relevant: The project was about how to use machine learning in EEG data to produce useful information out of it. Our role so far is to develop a clear set of easy problem to solve with simpler machine learning tools, followed by a secondary set of more difficult problem we aim to solve.

Time Bound: Done by next week.
