Smart Goal: Goal is to start small and slow down.

Specific: I will be classifying one flanker and one target of same context to get above chance classification score
			and I will be filtering epoch for only flanker and targets than set event id of flankers to 0 and targets
			to 1 so that I can do binary classification. I aim to get above chance level.

Measurable: Check classification score to see if results make sense and work done is working correctly.

Actionable: Look through notes from last week

Time Bound: Done by next week.
