# Smart and Stretch Goals

**Name:** Shateesh Bhugwansing
**Date:** 10/17/18

## Stretch Goals (1-3)

1. Pivot my individual role, start exploring visualization options.  
2. Generalize the classification experiments to include more than 1 subject's data. 

## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (next week)

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 1.

#### S. Specific: 
Use the montage file that Dave sent us to display epoched data in relation to the channel locations.  

#### M. Measurable: 
I can measure this goal with the number and quality of visuals that are produced using the MNE plot functions.   

#### A. Achievable: 
Not sure. This is brand new to me and will take some time learning how to do.  

#### R. Relevant :
This goal is relevant to presenting our machine learning results.  


#### T. Time-bound: 
I aim to get this done by 10/24/2018, but chances are that I'll need more time.   

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 2.

#### S. Specific: 
I will use an SVM, with more subjects' data, to classify their data into language vs. non-language responses.  

#### M. Measurable: 
Like all experiments thus far, I will measure the goal using built-in sklearn accuracy functions.   

#### A. Achievable: 
Yes, there is documentation on all sklearn classifiers. The work is similar to previous weeks, but with more data.   

#### R. Relevant :
This goal will help to generalize the results of our classification experiments thus far.  

#### T. Time-bound: 
Next week, 10/24/18

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 3.

#### S. Specific: 
Similar to smart goal #2, but with the logistic regression classifier.  

#### M. Measurable: 
I will measure this goal using the accuracy functions that are built-in in sklearn.  

#### A. Achievable: 
Yes, there is documentation on all sklearn classifiers. The work is similar to previous weeks, but with more data.   

#### R. Relevant :
like smart goal 2, This goal will help to generalize the results of our classification experiments thus far.  

#### T. Time-bound: 
Next week, 10/24/18


## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (last week)
1. Logistic regression, Language vs. Non-language: Completed the goal, Precision of ~65%
2. SVM, Language vs. Non-Language: Completed the goal, precision of ~73%
3. Did not get to use PCA data.
