## Status Update: Shateesh, Week 1 (09/05/2018)
#### SMART GOALS 
1. This week I will find relevant research papers that support the need for our revised project idea. I will start with Dr. Dave Britton's discertation and use his references as a guide. If these aren't enough, I will use the ACM, IEEE, and various psychology libraries that CCNY can access in order to find relevant papers. This goal will be measured by the length of the introduction, relevant works, and research definitions of the revised project proposal. I will get this done by next week. 

2. This week I will update our 'Future Works' section of the project proposal by clearly defining the different levels of problems that our group can solve. This is attainable after having our conversation with Dave where he specifically outlined problems that would be of interest to him and his lab. I will formalize the notes from our conversation on 09/04/2018 and send a follow up email to everyone involved to make sure we're on the same page moving forward. This goal is will be measured by the length and practicality of the 'Future Works' section of the revised project proposal. I will get this done by next week. 

3. This week I will update our 'Methods' section of the proposal to match the newly proposed project idea. After our conversation with Dave where he explained the original experiment set up where our data was collected from, I now have a better understanding of what our data is labeled as, which in turn allows me to plan out how we will analyze it. The classifications methods that we used on our old dataset can be used as a reference. This can be measured by how accurately the new 'Methods' section will describe our solutions to the new problem set proposed to us by both Dave Britton and Prof. Grossberg. I will get this done by next week.

###### Stretch
4. I will try to convert the ANT .cnt files that Dave provided for us into a .cnt file that can be read by the MNE library. Dave mentioned that his data collection method provides a very specific type of .cnt file, which is not yet compatible with MNE, and may need some tweaking. This goal can be measured by how many data files we can process using the MNE library. I will try to get this done by next week (09/12/2018) but if not, I will complete it by the following week (09/19/2018).
