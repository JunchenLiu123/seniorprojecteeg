# Smart and Stretch Goals

**Name:** Shateesh Bhugwansing
**Date:** 09/12/18

## Stretch Goals (1-3)

1. Visualize the results of our first classification problem: classify modality (audio vs. visual) of stimuli and get an accuracy score of 60-70%


## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (next week)
### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 1.

#### S. Specific: 
(What do you want to accomplish? Who needs to be included? When do you want to do this? Why is this a goal?)
* Improve our project proposal by incorporating Dave's feedback. I want to accomplish this by 09/19/2018. This is a goal because it will give our project more direction and confirm its relevancy to his work. 

#### M. Measurable: 
(How can you measure progress and know if you’ve successfully met your goal?)
* This is measurable by the changes in the project proposal since it's most recent version on 09/13/2018. 

#### A. Achievable: 
(Do you have the skills required to achieve the goal? If not, can you obtain them? What is the motivation for this goal? Is the amount of effort required on par with what the goal will achieve?)
* This goal is achievable because it does not require any new coding skills; I am just updating the proposal. 

#### R. Relevant :
(Why am I setting this goal now? Is it aligned with overall objectives like stretch goals?)
* This goal is critical to keeping our project proposal accurate and relevant to the psychology field. 

#### T. Time-bound: 
(What’s the deadline and is it realistic?)
* the deadline is 09/19/2018. 

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 2.

#### S. Specific: 
(What do you want to accomplish? Who needs to be included? When do you want to do this? Why is this a goal?)
* Our team will convert all raw EEG files, currently in ANT .cnt format, to .set files, which are compatible with MNE functions. This is a goal because it will allow our team to process Dave Britton's data using MNE, which we've had experience with from last semester. After the conversion is complete, we will store the data in the cloud using our student OneDrive accounts, provided by CCNY. 

#### M. Measurable: 
(How can you measure progress and know if you’ve successfully met your goal?)
* This goal can be measured by how many files from the original data set are converted to .set files. There are 66 .cnt files that need to be converted, manually.

#### A. Achievable: 
(Do you have the skills required to achieve the goal? If not, can you obtain them? What is the motivation for this goal? Is the amount of effort required on par with what the goal will achieve?)
* This goal is achievable because three out of the four members on our team have MATLAB installed on a machine readily accessible to them. The conversion process includes installing some EEG-specific packages for MATLAB, then importing each file individually into a MATLAB package called EEGLAB, and then saving the imported file as a .set file. Then we need to allocate enough time to upload our converted files to our cloud storage. I anticipate about 1-2 hours needed to keep our machines running during the uploading process. 

#### R. Relevant :
(Why am I setting this goal now? Is it aligned with overall objectives like stretch goals?)
* This goal is necessary for allowing all team members to access the data and work with it in MNE. 

#### T. Time-bound: 
(What’s the deadline and is it realistic?)
* The deadline is 09/19/2018.  

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 3.

#### S. Specific: 
(What do you want to accomplish? Who needs to be included? When do you want to do this? Why is this a goal?)
* I will research data visualization techniques that are appropriate for our classification problems. This is a goal because part of our project proposal is to have some form of visualization of our classification results and relevant mapping to the human brain. 

#### M. Measurable: 
(How can you measure progress and know if you’ve successfully met your goal?)
* I will report back to my team with a list of visualization techniques that we can use for our project. 

#### A. Achievable: 
(Do you have the skills required to achieve the goal? If not, can you obtain them? What is the motivation for this goal? Is the amount of effort required on par with what the goal will achieve?)
* This goal should be achievable. I do not know much about data visualization beyond what comes out of the box from sciKit Learn, so this will require a lot of research. 

#### R. Relevant :
(Why am I setting this goal now? Is it aligned with overall objectives like stretch goals?)
* Data visualization is a key component to our project proposal, and will occur for each of our classification problems. 

#### T. Time-bound: 
(What’s the deadline and is it realistic?)
* The deadline is 09/19/2018. This is a soft deadline, and may continue on into next week if necessary. 

### (you can add 2 more smart goals ... advisable)

## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (last week)

* find relevant research papers that support the need for our revised project idea, starting with Dave's dissertation and using his references as a guide.
    - refer to the background section of our project proposal for evidence 
* Update the 'Future Works' section of the proposal to include the new levels of classification problems proposed by Dave 
    - refer to the future works section of the project proposal 
* Update the Methods section of our project proposal to include a different set of learning algorithms that we will aim to use. 
    - refer the methods section of the proposal.
