# Smart and Stretch Goals

## Stretch Goals (1-3)

1. Start working on a better classifcation problem (Langauge vs. Non-Language) 


## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (next week)

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 1.

#### S. Specific: 
Use logistic regression to classify one subject's data into language vs. non-langage responses. 

#### M. Measurable: 
I can measure this goal by using the precision score and other built-in metrics in scikitlearn. 

#### A. Achievable: 
Yes. This classification experiment will be similar to what I was doing last week. 

#### R. Relevant :
This goal is relevant to solving more important classification problems, following the heirarchy listed in our project proposal. 


#### T. Time-bound: 
It is due next week: 10/17/18

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 2.

#### S. Specific: 
I will use an SVM to classify one's subject data into language vs. non-language responses. 

#### M. Measurable: 
Like all experiments thus far, I will measure the goal using built-in sklearn accuracy functions. 

#### A. Achievable: 
Yes, there is documentation on all sklearn classifiers. 

#### R. Relevant :
like goal #1, this goal will contribute to solving more important classification problems. 

#### T. Time-bound: 
Next week, 10/17/18

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 3.

#### S. Specific: 
I aim to reshape the data by filtering the PCA-reduced data according to their brain wave type, and run both classifiers from goals #1 and #2 and compare results. 

#### M. Measurable: 
I will measure this goal using the accuracy functions that are built-in in sklearn. 

#### A. Achievable: 
Yes, since all of the documentation is on the sklearn website. 

#### R. Relevant :
This will help our team decide on which classifier to use in the future and if PCA is appropriate for our experiments. 


#### T. Time-bound: 
I aim for next week, 10/17/18. BUT this depends on how far I get with goals #1 and #2


## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (last week)

1. Classify congruent vs. incongruent epochs using Linear Regression
  a. I got fairly high accuracy (> 90%) 
2. Classify congruent vs. incongruent epochs using SVM
  a. Also got fairly high accuracy (> 90%) 
3. Reshape the data based on brainwave types, and repeat goals #1 and #2
  a. did not get to this goal yet
