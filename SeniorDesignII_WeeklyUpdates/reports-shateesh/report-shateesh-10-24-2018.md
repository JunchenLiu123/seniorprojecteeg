# Smart and Stretch Goals

**Name:** Shateesh Bhugwansing
**Date:** 10/24/18

## Stretch Goals (1-3)

1. Figure out a custom way to visualize our data using MNE, because ANT data-type is not supported. 
2. Explore the coefficients used in Logistic Regression, try to map those to electrode positions/channels. 

## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (next week)

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 1.

#### S. Specific: 
Work with MNE developers and Dave to find a way to visualize electrode positions of the cap that Dave used in his experiment.

#### M. Measurable: 
This goal can be measured by following the issue thread that I made on the MNE repo  
(link here: https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/issues/5661)  


#### A. Achievable: 
Not quite sure. I have no expectations.    

#### R. Relevant :
This goal is relevant to presenting our machine learning results.   


#### T. Time-bound: 
I aim to get this done by 10/31/2018, but chances are that I'll need more time.    

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 2.

#### S. Specific: 
I will investigate the coefficients of the linear regression model that I used in previous classification experiments and map them to electrode positions (channels).  

#### M. Measurable: 
This will be measurable (hopefully) by a visual representation of the electrode positions and a heat map corresponding to the weights of the coefficients.  

#### A. Achievable: 
I think so. It depends on the resources that I can find about investigating a linear regression model.  

#### R. Relevant :
This goal will help our team understand the decision making process of the linear regression model with our data.  

#### T. Time-bound: 
Next week, 10/31/18, but may take more time. 

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 3.

#### S. Specific: 
Continue my smart goals from last week -- generalize the lexicality (language vs. non-langauge) problem using more than 1 subjects' data.   

#### M. Measurable: 
I will measure this goal using the accuracy functions that are built-in in sklearn.  

#### A. Achievable: 
Yes, there is documentation on all sklearn classifiers. The work is similar to previous weeks, but with more data.   

#### R. Relevant :
This goal will help to generalize the results of our classification experiments thus far.  

#### T. Time-bound: 
Next week, 10/31/18


## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (last week)
1. Display electrode positions: Did not work. the ANT duke waveguard cap that Dave used is not supported in MNE. I need to further investigate this. 
2. Use the SVM on the lexicality problem with more than 1 subject's data: didn't get to it because I was stuck on goal #1
3. Use the logistic regression model on the lexicality problem with more than 1 subject's data: didn't get to it because I was stuck on goal #1.
