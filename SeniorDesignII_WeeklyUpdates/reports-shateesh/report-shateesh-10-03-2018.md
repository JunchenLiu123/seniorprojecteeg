# Smart and Stretch Goals

## Stretch Goals (1-3)

1. Continue the experiments from last week. 


## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (next week)

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 1.

#### S. Specific: 
Investigate the results of target vs. flanker in the Logistic Regression and the SVM classifiers. I need to find out why I was getting 100% results for both classifiers. 

#### M. Measurable: 
I can measure this goal by producing results that make more sense (and not a perfect 100%) 

#### A. Achievable: 
I think so. I will have to research ways to classify EEG and compare other methods to what I've done. 

#### R. Relevant :
This goal is relevant to solving the first level of classification problem that we outlined in our proposal. 


#### T. Time-bound: 
It is due next week: 10/10/18

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 2.

#### S. Specific: 
I will run the same classifiers on PCA-reduced data (SMART GOAL #3 from week #4) 

#### M. Measurable: 
Like all experiments thus far, I will measure the goal using built-in sklearn accuracy functions. 

#### A. Achievable: 
Yes, there is documentation on all sklearn classifiers. 

#### R. Relevant :
Achieving this goal will prove whether we can use PCA-reduced data in the future. 

#### T. Time-bound: 
Next week, 10/10/18

### S.M.A.R.T. Goal 3.

#### S. Specific: 
I aim to reshape the data by filtering the PCA-reduced data according to their brain wave type, and run both classifiers from goals #1 and #2 and compare results. 

#### M. Measurable: 
I will measure this goal using the accuracy functions that are built-in in sklearn. 

#### A. Achievable: 
Yes, since all of the documentation is on the sklearn website. 

#### R. Relevant :
This will help our team decide on which classifier to use in the future. 


#### T. Time-bound: 
I aim for next week, 10/10/18. BUT this depends on how far I get with goals #1 and #2


## S.M.A.R.T. Goals (last week)

1. Classify target vs. flanker using Linear Regression: Got weird results (100% accuracy?) 
2. Classify target vs. flanker using SVM: Also got weird results  
3. Reshape the data based on brainwave types, and repeat goals #1 and #2: did not get to this goal yet, because goals 1 and 2 produced unusual results.
